                Remote sensing of rainfall events is critical for both operational and scientific needs, including for example weather forecasting, extreme flood mitigation, water cycle monitoring, etc. Ground-based weather radars, such as NOAA's Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD), provide reflectivity and precipitation measurements of rainfall events. However, the observation range of such radars is limited to a few hundred kilometers, prompting the exploration of other remote sensing methods, paricularly over the open ocean, that represents large areas not covered by land-based radars. For a number of decades, C-band SAR imagery such a such as Sentinel-1 imagery has been known to exhibit rainfall signatures over the sea surface. However, the development of SAR-derived rainfall products remains a challenge. Here we propose a deep learning approach to extract rainfall information from SAR imagery. We demonstrate that a convolutional neural network, such as U-Net, trained on a colocated and preprocessed Sentinel-1/NEXRAD dataset clearly outperforms state-of-the-art filtering schemes. Our results indicate high performance in segmenting precipitation regimes, delineated by thresholds at 1, 3, and 10 mm/h. Compared to current methods that rely on Koch filters to draw binary rainfall maps, these multi-threshold learning-based models can provide rainfall estimation for higher wind speeds and thus may be of great interest for data assimilation weather forecasting or for improving the qualification of SAR-derived wind field data.

                Through the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) embarked on the satellites Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B of the Copernicus program, a large quantity of observations is routinely acquired over the oceans. A wide range of features from both oceanic (e.g., biological slicks, icebergs, etc.) and meteorologic origin (e.g., rain cells, wind streaks, etc.) are distinguishable on these acquisitions. This paper studies the semantic segmentation of ten metoceanic processes either in the context of a large quantity of image-level groundtruths (i.e., weakly-supervised framework) or of scarce pixel-level groundtruths (i.e., fully-supervised framework). Our main result is that a fully-supervised model outperforms any tested weakly-supervised algorithm. Adding more segmentation examples in the training set would further increase the precision of the predictions. Trained on 20 × 20 km imagettes acquired from the WV acquisition mode of the Sentinel-1 mission, the model is shown to generalize, under some assumptions, to wide-swath SAR data, which further extents its application domain to coastal areas.

                The consistent and long-term spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions such as Sentinel-1 (S-1) provide high-quality dual-polarized C-band images particularly suited to sea ice monitoring. SAR data are currently the primary source of information for sea ice charting made by human ice experts as a result of its integration with multiple information sources at different scales (mainly radiometers). The rise of deep learning now opens the prospect of automatic sea ice mapping. In this article, we investigate the potential of a fully convolutional network (FCN) for the automatic estimation of sea ice concentration (SIC). With input data down-sampled at 200 m and an FCN architecture (depth and receptive field) duly parameterized, our approach is to mimic the work of an analyst who considers general context and does not necessarily use the highest possible resolution but speckle-noise polluted data. A comprehensive database is generated with 1320 dual-polarized S-1 scenes collocated with ice charts produced by MET Norway. A dedicated attention is paid to seasonal representativeness to ensure the adequate performance for all sea ice types. Even if the FCN output is modeled as a categorical problem, the proposed architecture accounts for the semantic distances between SIC classes by introducing an auxiliary loss. A comparative benchmark with Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) and MET Norway SIC products is carried out, showing an overall accuracy of 78.2% for our 6-class classification approach. The FCN model is shown to be evenly robust to sea ice seasonal variability and incidence angle.

                Windrows signatures on SAR images are analyzed to estimate their orientation and their estimated accuracy with respect to reference wind direction provided by buoy and model. The accuracy dependency to several parameters of interest such as wind speed, processing internal variables, incidence angle, a priori presence of wind streaks but also SAR product acquisition modes and polarizations is analyzed. Regression models provide a satisfying method to combine these parameters and predict the a priori error on the estimated wind direction, crucial for any downstream application.

                Spaceborne observations over extreme atmospheric events at global scale such as Tropical Cyclones, Extra-Tropical Cyclones, Polar Lows and Medicanes are a key component in extreme events monitoring and in anticipating appropriate risk mitigation and emergency response at landfall. In particular, meteorological forecasters and numerical modelers need to access various sources of conventional and specialized data/products including remote sensing observations to refine their analysis or adjust their models.<br>Recent progresses in SAR processing have shown the potential of C-band SAR data acquired in dualpolarization for estimating at high-resolution (1 km) an ocean surface wind field, including extreme events such as major hurricanes (category-3 to-5). Comparison with SFMR for yield to high correlation (R> 0.90), small bias (< 0.5 ms-1) and RMSE (< 5 ms-1), including at highest wind speeds (80 ms-1).
